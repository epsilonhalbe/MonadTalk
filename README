This is the literate Haskell source code for a talk for Lambdaheads, a local
group interested in functional programming at metalab.at (Vienna).

You can use the *.hs/*.lhs files with ghci by `ghci StateExample.hs` and
`ghci MonadTalk.lhs`.

If you want to compile the slides on your own please change the extension of
*.lhs to *.tex and compile with LuaTex.
